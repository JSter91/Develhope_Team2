# Team Projects Showcase üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the showcase of team projects completed during my course at DevelHope. Here are three projects that highlight our collaborative efforts and skills development:

## 1. Netflix Replica

Our team worked on replicating the popular streaming platform Netflix using only HTML and CSS. Despite the simplicity of the tools, we aimed to capture the essence of the Netflix interface, focusing on layout, styling, and responsiveness.

## 2. Electronic Arts Website Replica

In this project, our team recreated the website of Electronic Arts (EA) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We paid close attention to detail, striving to emulate the design and functionality of the original site. Interactive features were implemented to enhance the user experience.

## 3. Nebula: Space Travel Website

For our final project, we conceptualized and developed Nebula, a fictional website dedicated to space travel experiences. Leveraging React.js and Node.js, we created an immersive platform that offers information about space destinations, booking options, and interactive features for users interested in space exploration.
